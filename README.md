# One of These Things

This is a portfolio project I built to get more familiar with making API requests and React. 

## About 

In each level, the user is presented with 5 images of the same animal and one image of a different animal. The object of the game is to pick the animal that doesn't belong and complete all three levels as quickly as possible.

The app keeps track of your time and allows you to copy it to your clipboard to share after completing the game. An incorrect guess will reset the timer and return you to level one. 

## Limitations 

The Unsplash API account for this project is in demo mode and is limited to 50 requests per hour. If you play for too long, you'll reach that limit and will have to wait for more requests to become available.
